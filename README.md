# Build Templates #

Often when creating a project I find my build scripts have commonalities
between them. I want some kind of `compile` target, a `clean` target etc.
Creating a new build script, whether that's a Makefile or Ant build.xml, from
scratch each time seems wasteful. So in this repository are starting points
for different build systems (normally that I have used). Some are just
starting points and others are fairly comprehensive.

## Simplified Templates ##

I have included a simplified Makefile for people who are unfamiliar with them
which is heavily annotated with comments and good for a starting point for
small projects.

## Templates ##

The following templates are in this repository:

* Ant
    * Java
* CMake
    * C
* Makefile
    * C
    * C++
