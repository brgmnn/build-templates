# Makefiles #

Often I find my Makefiles have common features between them. I want a `clean`
target, I want an `all` target, I don't want any unnecessary building. Some of
these things are easy, others (like proper dependency handling) are not as
easy. This repository contains template Makefiles that I use to start my
Makefiles for projects. They can generally be used with minimal modification.

## Templates ##

The following templates are in this repo:

* Make
    * C++
