This is quite experimental as I am still playing around with Go, so this may
not be the best setup for compiling Go with GNU Make.

## Usage ##

Compile the HelloWorld program with `make` and then run HelloWorld with
`./bin/HelloWorld`. Clean the project with `make clean`.

## Dependencies ##

* GNU Make.
* Python.
* A terminal that supports colour codes.
* Golang.

Python is used only to calculate the maximum line length of a list of lines.
